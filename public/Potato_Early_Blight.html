        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" onclick="toggleVisibility('aboutCondition')">About the condition</h2>
        <p id="aboutCondition" class="center">Early Blight is a common fungal disease in potatoes caused by the fungus Alternaria solani.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" onclick="toggleVisibility('lifecycle')">Life Cycle</h2>
        <p id="lifecycle" class="center">Early Blight spreads through spores produced on infected plant debris, soil, or other contaminated materials. Warm and humid conditions favor its development.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" onclick="toggleVisibility('symptoms')">Symptoms</h2>
        <p id="symptoms" class="center">The disease primarily affects the leaves of the potato plant. It starts with the appearance of small, dark brown lesions with concentric rings, resembling a target. These lesions may expand and merge, leading to the browning and wilting of leaves. In severe cases, it can affect stems and tubers.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" onclick="toggleVisibility('impact')">Impact</h2>
        <p id="impact" class="center">The disease can reduce the photosynthetic area of the leaves, affecting the plant's ability to produce energy. Severe infections may lead to reduced yield and quality of potato tubers.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" onclick="toggleVisibility('treatmentrecomendations')">Treatment recomendations</h2>
        <p id="treatmentrecomendations" class="center">1. Remove and destroy any infected plant material to reduce the source of spores; 2. Application of fungicides containing active ingredients like chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based compounds can help manage Early Blight. Regular and timely application, following recommended dosage and schedule, is essential for effectiveness.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;" onclick="toggleVisibility('preventionstrategies')">Prevention long term strategies</h2>
        <p id="preventionstrategies" class="center">1. Planting potato varieties that are resistant or less susceptible to Early Blight can be an effective long-term strategy. Resistant varieties are bred to withstand the disease, reducing the need for extensive chemical treatments; 2. Practicing crop rotation helps disrupt the disease cycle. Avoid planting potatoes or other susceptible crops in the same location for consecutive growing seasons; 3. Planting potatoes with adequate spacing promotes better air circulation, reducing the humidity around the plants. This can create an environment less favorable for the development and spread of Early Blight; 4. Regularly inspect the potato plants for symptoms of Early Blight. Promptly remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris to limit the source of spores; 5. Applying organic mulch around the base of the potato plants can help prevent soil splash, which may carry fungal spores. Mulching also helps maintain consistent soil moisture; 6. Watering at the base of the plants instead of using overhead irrigation can minimize leaf wetness, creating an environment less conducive to fungal growth; 7. Practices such as proper field sanitation, weed control, and balanced fertilization contribute to overall plant health and resilience against diseases.</p>
